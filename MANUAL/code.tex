 \subsection{\tt allocate\_block\_memory}
 This subroutine assigns to every block {\sl i} a number of node 
 points {\sl block(i)\%np} and a number of cells {\sl block(i)\%ncell}  
 The number of vertices per cell is also stored in {\sl block(i)\%nv}.
 It then loops over all blocks and allocates the required arrays 
 to store the mesh nodes position in Cartesian and spherical coordinates
 and the connectivity.  
 \subsection{\tt block\_node\_layout}
 This subroutine generates the position of the mesh node points for each 
 block as well as their connectivity (i.e. the list of nodes making 
 each element. 
 \begin{center}

 {\small a) block layout for mtype=3,4; b) block layout for mtype=5}
 \end{center}
 In the case that the block is a quadrilateral, it is assumed that 
 it is made of $l \times l$ quadrilateral cells. In the case that the block is a 
 triangle, it is made of $l^2$ triangular cells.
 \subsection{\tt build\_hollow\_sphere}
 This subroutine first makes a copy of the current shell into {\sl shell\_temp}
 It then computes the number of mesh nodes and cells for the hollow sphere
 and allocate all arrays accordingly.
 It then loops over layers, places the temporary shell at the required 
 radius, and appends it to the current hollow sphere mesh from the inside out.

 following Eq.(12) of \cite{gran97}.
 \subsection{\tt compute\_gravity\_at\_point}
 This subroutine receives as argument the coordinates {\tt x,y,z} of a point and 
 returns the gravity vector components {\tt gx,gy,gz} at this location 
 by means of 
 \[
 {\bm g}({\bm r}') = \int_\Omega {\cal G} \frac{\rho({\bm r})-\rho_0}{|{\bm r}'-{\bm r}|^3} ({\bm r}'-{\bm r}) d\Omega
 \] 
 where $\rho_0=${\tt refdensgrav}.
 The gravitational potential is computed as follows:
 \[

 \]
 \subsection{\tt compute\_gravity\_on\_line}

 Results are generated in the {\sl fort.889} file.
 \subsection{\tt compute\_triangle\_area}
 {\tt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron\%27s\_formula }
 Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is
 \[
 A=\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
 \]

 \[
 s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}
 \]
 \subsection{\tt generate\_quadrature\_points}
 This routine computes the location of all quadrature points
 \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian\_quadrature} of the mesh. 
 If the mesh is based on hexahedra (HS06,HS12) each cell counts 2x2x2 quadrature points
 each with a weight of 1.
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/elements}
 \end{center}
 If the mesh is based on triangular prisms (HS20) it has 2x3 quadrature points, 
 (2 in the radial direction and 3 in the triangular plane) and the weights are 1/6.
 All q-points are generated in the reference cell and then mapped out to real 
 cells by means of a linear mapping.
 For hexahedral elements the linear shape functions are:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 N_1(r,s,t) &=& (1-r)(1-s)(1-t)/8 \nonumber\\ 
 N_2(r,s,t) &=& (1+r)(1-s)(1-t)/8 \nonumber\\ 
 N_3(r,s,t) &=& (1+r)(1+s)(1-t)/8 \nonumber\\ 
 N_4(r,s,t) &=& (1-r)(1+s)(1-t)/8 \nonumber\\ 
 N_5(r,s,t) &=& (1-r)(1-s)(1+t)/8 \nonumber\\ 
 N_6(r,s,t) &=& (1+r)(1-s)(1+t)/8 \nonumber\\ 
 N_7(r,s,t) &=& (1+r)(1+s)(1+t)/8 \nonumber\\ 
 N_8(r,s,t) &=& (1-r)(1+s)(1+t)/8 \nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
 For the triangular prism elements the linear shape functions are:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 N_1(r,s,t) &=& (1-r-s)(1-t)/2 \nonumber\\ 
 N_2(r,s,t) &=& r(1-t)/2 \nonumber\\ 
 N_3(r,s,t) &=& s(1-t)/2 \nonumber\\ 
 N_4(r,s,t) &=& (1-r-s)(1+t)/2 \nonumber\\ 
 N_5(r,s,t) &=& r(1+t)/2 \nonumber\\ 
 N_6(r,s,t) &=& s(1+t)/2 \nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}

 \subsubsection{HS20 - Icosahedron}
 Let $t=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$, then the vertices of the icosahedron are 
 \[
 {\bm x}_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(t,1,0) \quad\quad {\bm x}_6=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(-1,0,t)
 \]
 \[
 {\bm x}_1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(-t,1,0) \quad\quad {\bm x}_7=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(-1,0,-t)
 \]
 \[
 {\bm x}_2=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(t,-1,0) \quad\quad {\bm x}_8=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(0,t,1)
 \]
 \[
 {\bm x}_3=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(-t,-1,0) \quad\quad {\bm x}_9=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(0,-t,1)
 \]
 \[
 {\bm x}_4=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(1,0,t) \quad\quad {\bm x}_{10}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(0,t,-1)
 \]
 \[
 {\bm x}_5=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(1,0,-t) \quad\quad {\bm x}_{11}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(0,-t,-1)
 \]
 It is obvious that all points lie on a sphere of unit radius.

 The triangles are as follows:
 \[  T_0=[0,8,4]  \quad\quad T_{10}=[2,9,11]   \]
 \[  T_1=[0,5,10] \quad\quad T_{11}=[3,11,9]   \]
 \[  T_2=[2,4,9]  \quad\quad T_{12}=[4,2,0]   \]
 \[  T_3=[2,11,5] \quad\quad T_{13}=[5,0,2]   \]
 \[  T_4=[1,6,8]  \quad\quad T_{14}=[6,1,3]   \]
 \[  T_5=[1,10,7] \quad\quad T_{15}=[7,3,1]   \]
 \[  T_6=[3,9,6]  \quad\quad T_{16}=[8,6,4]   \]
 \[  T_7=[3,7,11] \quad\quad T_{17}=[9,4,6]   \]
 \[  T_8=[0,10,8] \quad\quad T_{18}=[10,5,7]   \]
 \[  T_9=[1,8,10] \quad\quad T_{19}=[11,7,5]   \]
